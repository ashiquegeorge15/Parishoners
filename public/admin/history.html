      <h2>
        The history of the Mar Thoma Church is divided into three main eras:
      </h2>
      <p>Pre-Reformation</p>
      <p>Reformation</p>
      <p>Post Reformation</p>

      <h2>Pre-Reformation Era</h2>
      <p>
        St. Thomas, the Apostle of Jesus Christ is believed to have landed in AD
        52 in Cranganore near Cochin, which was at that time an important
        seaport on the Malabar Coast, having trade connections with the Middle
        East in those days. F.E. Keay in his book, A History of the Syrian
        Church in India, has established, from the mention in the book of Kings,
        of the articles brought to the court of King Solomon from India, that
        even before the time of Christ, there was trade between the Malabar
        Coast and Palestine in spices and luxury articles like ivory.
      </p>
      <p>
        Therefore, it was quite natural for Thomas to come to India with the
        Gospel as the disciples went to different parts of the world in
        accordance with the commission given to them by Jesus Christ. In the
        true Apostolic tradition he preached first to the Jewish settlers in and
        around Cochin, and then worked among the Hindus. Through the ministry of
        the Word and the many miracles which tradition attributes to him, he
        brought many high caste Hindus to the Christian faith. It is believed
        that he organized 7 Christian communities for the use of these
        Christians, and ordained presbyters from four leading families.
      </p>

      <h2>The seven churches were:</h2>
      <p>Cranganore (Malankara)</p>
      <p>Chavakad (Palur)</p>
      <p>Parur near Alwaye</p>
      <p>Gokamangalam</p>
      <p>Niranam</p>
      <p>Nilakkal (Chayal)</p>
      <p>Quilon (Kalyan)</p>


      <p>
        All these places except Nilakkal are near the sea coast. Nilakkal is in
        the ghat region near Sabarimala, the Hindu place of pilgrimage. It is
        believed that Nilakkal was an important trading centre for export of
        spices and other items like ivory, and the route extended to Tamil Nadu
        across the ghats. Remains of ancient human dwellings and places of
        worship are still discernible among the ruins in this area, which is now
        covered with forests. Many Christian families in Kanjirappally, Ayroor
        and other places trace their origin to Nilakkal. There is a Mar Thoma
        Church at Ayroor which is still named Chayal (Nilakkal).
      </p>
      <p>
        Recently a new Church has been built under the joint auspices of all the
        Christian denominations of Kerala at the site agreed upon by all
        concerned. This Church has historical significance as the first Church
        built and dedicated by all the denominations together as a symbol of the
        heritage from St. Thomas. It is believed that St. Thomas proceeded to
        the East coast of India and died a martyr’s death at a place called St.
        Thomas Mount, and was buried at Mylapore in Madras.
      </p>

      <h5>
        Dr. Juhanon Mar Thoma Metropolitan concludes the Chapter on the St.
        Thomas Tradition in his book Christianity in India and a Brief History
        of the Mar Thoma Church as follows:
      </h5>
      <p>
        “The History of the Christian Church in the first century does not
        depend entirely on historical documents. Tradition is often more true
        and more compelling than plain historic proof. In this sense St. Peter’s
        founding of the Roman Church and St. Thomas’ founding of the Malabar
        Church, may be said to stand on the same footing. Both are supported by
        traditions which are sufficiently early and sufficiently strong”.
      </p>
      <p>
        Mention is made in the records of the Council of Nicea (AD 325), of the
        presence of a Bishop John of India. Jawaharlal Nehru in his ‘Glimpses of
        World History’ (1934) commented as follows:- “You may be surprised to
        learn that Christianity came to India long before it went to England or
        Western Europe, and when even in Rome it was a despised and proscribed
        sect. Within 100 years or so of the death of Jesus, Christian
        Missionaries came to South India by sea. They were received courteously
        and permitted to preach their new faith. They converted a large number
        of people, and their descendants have lived there, with varying fortune,
        to this day. Most of them belong to old Christian sects which have
        ceased to exist in Europe.”
      </p>
      <p>
        The history of this ancient Church during 4th to 15th centuries reveals
        the fact that it was in friendly relations with the Church in Persia.
        There is a tradition that a group of 400 immigrants from Persia arrived
        in Malabar in AD 345 under the leadership of a merchant named Thomas of
        Cana, known as Knaye Thommen. Mention is made also of another
        immigration from Persia in the year AD 825 under the leadership of a
        Persian merchant named Marwan Sabriso with two Bishops named Mar Sapro
        and Mar Prodh. They landed in Quilon. King Cheraman Perumal gave them
        land and extended to them special privileges, inscribed on two sets of
        Copper Plates (in Malayalam “Chepped”). Three of these are still in the
        Old Seminary in Kottayam and two are at the Mar Thoma Church Head
        Quarters, Tiruvalla.
      </p>
      <p>
        There was ecclesiastical connection between the Church in West Asia and
        the Church in Malabar till 16th century. The Bishops who came from
        Babylonian Patriarchate were Nestorians. Even now there is a Nestorian
        Church in Trichur, called the Chaldean Syrian Church. They are connected
        with the Nestorian Patriarch. Though there were such ecclesiastical
        connections and ministrations, the Church in Malabar was independent in
        administration under its own Archdeacons.
      </p>
      <p>
        The Portuguese started settling in India with the coming of Vasco De
        Gama in AD 1498. They established their power in the 16th & the 17th
        centuries. This was also a period, which witnessed far-reaching effects
        of the missionary adventures of the Roman Catholic Church. At this time,
        the Portuguese were powerful in the eastern areas and had control of the
        sea routes. The Roman Catholic Church wanted to use this opportunity to
        bring the Church in Malabar under the supremacy of Rome. A powerful
        Archbishop Alexio-de-Menezes arrived in Goa in 1592. He then convened a
        Synod at Udayamperoor, south of Ernakulam, in the year 1599, called the
        Synod of Diamper for commandeering obedience to the supreme Bishop of
        Rome. The representatives sent from various congregations were forced to
        accept the decrees read out by the Archbishop. Thus the Syrian
        Christians of Malabar, (the Malankara Church) were made part of the
        Roman Catholic Church under the Pope. The Malankara Church was under
        Roman Empire for half a century. But many smarted under the Roman Yoke.
        Gradually the power of the Portuguese empire declined and the Christians
        yearned for regaining independence.
      </p>
      <p>
        They tried to get a prelate from one of the Eastern Churches to lead the
        people out of this torpid state of affairs. And when their efforts were
        proved futile, they declared their independence and shook off the Roman
        supremacy after 54 years of submission, with the ‘Oath of Coonen Cross’
        in AD 1653. That was a historic event, which inscribed a new chapter in
        the history of the Church in Malabar. What they wanted was to remain
        loyal to their ancient faith and traditions.
      </p>
      <p>
        Their dream was finally materialized when their Archdeacon, Thomas by
        name, was duly consecrated with the title ‘Mar Thoma’ in 1665 by Mar
        Gregorius of Jerusalem who was associated with the Jacobite Patriarchate
        of Antioch. Thus the Episcopal continuity was restored with Mar Thoma I
        as the first Indian Metropolitan. Thus began the relation of the Syrian
        Church with the Antiochene Jacobites. Because of the relationship with
        the Syrian Church, the Church in Malankara (Malabar) was also known as
        Syrian Church of Malabar.
      </p>
      <p>
        The throne used for this consecration in 1655 is still in the possession
        of the Mar Thoma Church and kept in the Poolatheen, the residence of the
        Malankara Metropolitan at Tiruvalla. It has been used in the
        installation of every Mar Thoma Metropolitan, to this day, so that the
        continuity of the throne of Mar Thoma is ensured.
      </p>
      <p>
        Thereafter, Ten Bishops with the title of ‘Mar Thoma’ were consecrated
        who held ecclesiastical authority over the Malankara Church from 1653 to
        1843. Of the ten Bishops, four had assumed the title Mar Dionysius.
      </p>
      <p>
        During the time of Mar Thoma VI, who took the title of Dionysius I, Mar
        Gregorios, a foreign Bishop consecrated a new Bishop with the title Mar
        Koorilos. Mar Dionysus raised objections and Mar Koorilos had
        established his seat at Thozhiyoor, near Kunnamkulam on the British
        Malabar border. This Church continued as an independent church from that
        time. This Church maintains cordial relations with the Mar Thoma Church,
        especially for inter-church consecration of Bishops even on date.
      </p>
      <p>
        By this time, Malankara Syrian Christians had developed close relations
        with the missionaries sent from Church Mission Society in London. But
        soon seeds of misunderstanding were sown and cracks appeared in their
        relationship. This gap widened and ultimately resulted in their parting
        of ways. With the converts they gained and with the Syrians who joined
        them eventually, a branch of the Church of England known as the Diocese
        of Travancore and Cochin was formed (1879).
      </p>
      <p>
        But that was not the end. There was a nucleus of people in the church
        who longed for the removal of unscriptural customs and practices which
        had crept into the church over the centuries. They envisioned a
        reformation in the Church in the light of the Gospel of our Lord. There
        were two outstanding leaders in this group, one was Palakunnathu Abraham
        Malpan of Maramon (1796-1845) and the other, Kaithayil Geevarghese
        Malpan of Puthuppally (1800-1855). Both were teachers in the Syrian
        Seminary (established in AD 1813 by Pulikottil Mar Dionysius) and had
        opportunities to come into close personal contact with the missionaries
        and to share their insights regarding the Christian life and the nature
        and functioning of the Church as depicted in the New Testament and to
        imbibe the ideas of the Western Reformation. The group led by these two
        was very much concerned about the need of a revival in the Church.
      </p>
      <h2>Reformation Movement</h2>
      <p>
        Palakkunnathu Abraham Malpan from Maramon and Kaithayil Geevarghese
        Malpan from Kottayam who spearheaded this movement, never wanted to
        start a separate Church. They wanted the reformation, staying within the
        Church. This group gradually became vocal and approached Col. Fraser,
        the British Resident, with a memorandum in 1836 . But since nothing came
        of it, Abraham Malpan decided to take action in his own parish of
        Maramon which was sympathetic towards his ideas of reform. He translated
        the liturgy of the Holy Qurbana into local language Malayalam from
        Syriac and also eliminated from it the prayers for the dead and
        invocation of saints etc. He celebrated Holy Qurbana in his church using
        the revised St.James liturgy on a Sunday in 1836. This was tantamount to
        firing the first shot of the reformation. He later on removed from the
        church the wooden image of a saint reputed to have miraculous powers,
        and in whose honor an annual festival was held that brought in huge
        income to the Parish. Both at Maramon and at the Syrian Seminary at
        Kottayam, and in the neighboring Parishes of Pallom and Kollad, Abraham
        Malpan popularized Bible teaching and preaching. Abraham Malpan and
        Geevarghese Malpan had to give up their service in the Seminary, in
        1840. Since then Abraham Malpan concentrated his attention on the work
        of reform, holding Bible classes and prayer meetings and instructing the
        deacons who were loyal to him.
      </p>

      <h2>Most prominent elements in the Reformation were:</h2>
      <p>Return to the gospel message of salvation by faith in Jesus Christ;</p>
      <p>Cleansing of wrong ways of life, and</p>
      <p>Taking up responsibility to be witnesses of Jesus Christ to other;</p>
      <p>All importance be given to the primacy of the Word of God.</p>
      <p>
        Thus the reformation movement was started. It was a return to the purity
        of the life and practice of the early Church. The emphasis on preaching
        the word of God led to revival meetings, which were led both by the
        clergy and laymen. The domination of the clergy as custodians of grace
        became a thing of the past. Emphasis was given to the sole mediation of
        Christ, importance of laity and priesthood of all believers. More and
        more groups were formed for Bible study; and conventions for preaching
        and hearing the Word of God became common.
      </p>
      <p>
        Metropolitan Chepat Mar Dionysius was not prepared to accept such
        changes. So he refused to ordain the deacons who had undergone training
        with Abraham Malpan. He also excommunicated Abraham Malpan. So Abraham
        Malpan went to his mother-parish at Maramon. He stood strong in faith
        and convictions when faced with serious challenges and great
        difficulties. However the whole parish stood with him. Others who
        favoured the reforms went to hear his preaching and were strengthed by
        his exhortations. Some other parishes also decided to adopt the
        programme of reformation. Abraham Malpan realized that unless he had the
        support of a bishop who was sympathetic towards his reforms, there was
        little prospect of the movement gaining ground. So he sent his nephew
        Deacon Mathew, who was then studying in Madras, to the Patriarch at
        Mardin in Syria. The Patriarch, being impressed with the character and
        ability of the deacon, in due course ordained him as priest and
        consecrated him as Metropolitan, with the name Mathews Mar Athanasius.
        The new Bishop arrived in Cochin in 1843 with credentials received from
        the Patriarch.
      </p>
      <p>
        The new Metropolitan went to Trivandrum and tried to obtain the Royal
        proclamation declaring him as the Metropolitan of the Malankara Church.
        Chepat Mar Dionysius opposed this. Mathews Mar Athanasius got the royal
        proclamation in 1852 declaring him as the Metropolitan of the Malankara
        Church. Abraham Malpan died at the early age of 49 years in 1845. Having
        received the Royal proclamation, Mathews Mar Athanasius made himself
        more active and involved in the cause of reformation. Years later a
        group led by Pulikottil Joseph Mar Dionysius who was consecrated by the
        Patriarch of Antioch worked vigorously against him and his attempts to
        continue reformation. Mathews Mar Athanasius, consecratd his cousin
        Abraham Malpan’s son, as Thomas Mar Athanasius in 1868. The reformed
        party had possession of the Syrian Seminary as Mathews Mar Athanasius
        had been declared as the Malankara Metropolitan. The Partriarch of
        Antioch himself came to Kerala in 1875. A prolonged litigation followed,
        as to who was the rightful Malankara Metropolitan. Mathews Mar
        Athanasius died in 1877 and Thomas Mar Athanasius had to carry the
        burden of conducting the court cases, for the possession of the Syrian
        Seminary and Church property. This case was decided in the royal court
        of appeal in Trivandrum, in 1889. Two judges decreed that Joseph Mar
        Dionysius was the rightful Metropolitan of the Malankara Church as he
        expressed allegiance to the Patriarch of Antioch. One Christian Judge
        gave the verdict in favour of Thomas Mar Athanasius because of his
        conviction that the Malankara Church has been an independent Church from
        the beginning. The majority view prevailed and Thomas Mar Athanasius had
        to leave the Syrian Seminary and the properties there, because he upheld
        the autonomy of the Church. It was suggested that Thomas Mar Athanasius
        would be recognized as Malankara Metropolitan, if he agreed that future
        consecrations of Bishops should be by the Partriarch of Anticoh. He did
        not agree to this proposal as it was against the autonomy of the Church.
      </p>
      <p>
        Again, litigation continued for the possession of individual churches.
        The reform party got only Maramon and Kozhencherry churches by court
        decision, and the Kottarakara church without contest. Five churches were
        to be used by the two parties on alternate Sundays. They put up small
        sheds in other places to hold worship services.
      </p>
      <p>
        Even though the reform party lost their hereditary and rightful
        possession, it became the occasion for the people to turn to God and to
        go forward in faith, trusting in the power of God. This led to a
        spiritual revival and great joy in spite of difficulties. It was this
        spiritual fervour which sustained the people. The Maramon Convention
        (Evangelistic Meeting) was started about this time in the year 1896. The
        famous Maramon Convention which we have been holding annually for over a
        century, is a source of great spiritual power and inspiration for
        innumerable people. The losses were forgotten in the zeal of spiritual
        fulfillment. The concern for the spread of the Gospel gave momentum to
        the reformation movement. The successive Metropolitans of the Church
        also continued in the same spirit, with the help of dedicated clergy
        whose leadership and sacrificial lives have been deeply appreciated by
        the people in the Church.
      </p>
      <h2>Post Reformation</h2>
      <p>
        Though the reformists succeeded in introducing the revised order of
        worship and successfully discontinued many practices, they had to pay a
        heavy price for achieving the desired result and had to face serious
        mental and financial strains arising out of the prolonged legal battles.
        In pursuance of the judgment handed out by the Royal Court of Appeal,
        Bishops consecrated by the reformists group lost control of the
        Malankara Church and had to vacate the Syrian Seminary at Kottayam,
        considered as the headquarters of the Malankara Church.
      </p>
      <p>
        Our forefathers, however, did not lose heart. On the contrary, the
        material loss and humiliation suffered by them infused renewed vigour
        and hope in their minds and gave them the confidence to start rebuilding
        the Church from scratch, laying their trust in God almighty. There has
        been a phenomenal expansion of the Church during the last six decades,
        widening its frontiers to various countries of West Asia, Africa, North
        America and Western Europe.
      </p>
      <p>
        The Church has now 1246 parishes including congregations, divided into
        thirteen dioceses. There are 11 Bishops including the Metropolitan and
        925 active priests (and 224 retired priests). It has a democratic
        pattern of administration with a representative assembly (Prathinidhi
        Mandalam), an executive council (Sabha Council) and an Episcopal Synod.
      </p>
      <p>
        The Church has been active in the field of education and owns Colleges,
        Higher Secondary Schools, Vocational Higher Secondary School, High
        Schools, Training School and other educational institutions owned and
        managed by individual parishes. The Church has social welfare
        institutions, destitute homes and Hospitals. The Mar Thoma Tehological
        Seminary (Estd: in 1926) and other Theological Institutes cater to the
        theological education of both the clergy and the laity. Further, there
        are Study Centres, for arranging regular study programmes and to provide
        opportunities for creative dialogue between church and society on
        various ethical, moral, social and religious issues. The religious
        education of children is looked after by the Christian Education
        Department – the Sunday School Samajam (organized in 1905) and the work
        among youth is carried on by the Youth Department – the Yuvajana Sakhyam
        (organized in 1933). The Church has a women’s department – the Mar Thoma
        Suvisesha Sevika Sanghom (organized in 1919) which is vigorously active.

      <h2>The Ecumenical Nature:</h2>
      <p>
        The Church actively participates in the programmes of the World Council
        of Churches, the Christian Conference of Asia, the National Council of
        Churches and the Kerala Christian Council. It is in full communion with
        the Anglican Church, The Church of South India and the Church of North
        India and has cordial relations with the various denominations of the
        Christian Church. The Church actively co-operates with the C.S.I. and
        the C.N.I. through CCI (Communion of Churches in India).

      <p>
        The Mar Thoma Church is financially independent and maintains its
        indigenous nature. Its regular work as well as special projects are
        almost entirely financed by contributions from its members at home and
        abroad.
      </p>
      <p>
        While the history of the Church especially during the last century shows
        advance and growth in various directions, it will be admitted that there
        is little room for complacency. In the life of the individual as well as
        the community, we lag far behind the standard set by our Lord. The
        Church is in need of renewal in Spirit in order to become more effective
        and useful instrument in His hands for the extension of His Kingdom. As
        members of the Church let us therefore surrender ourselves under the
        mighty hand of God so that He may exalt us and use us for His glory in
        the years to come.
